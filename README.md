# Overview of Our Solutions (a website)
Myntra - WeforShe Hackathon

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- The main aim of this website is to showcase our solutions and approaches through a website for better and easy understanding.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
